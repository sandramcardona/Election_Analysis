# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Borad of Elections employee has given me the tasks below to complete the election audit of a recent locatl congressional election.

1. Calculate the Total number of votes cast in this congressional election.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the Percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources

- Software: Python 3.9.0, Visual Studio Code, 1.50

## Summary

Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.

Finally, you’ll provide a written analysis of the election audit for the election commission, including the new results and a clearly written overview of your methods. As with all written analyses, this will help your audience understand what you did and what they might be able to do with the data you presented.

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to deliver your results. You will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: The Election Results Printed to the Command Line
Deliverable 2: The Election Results Saved to a Text File
Deliverable 3: A written Analysis of the Election Audit (README.md)
