## Project Overview
A Colorado Borad of Elections employee has given me the tasks below to complete the election audit of a recent locatl congressional election.

1. Calculate the Total number of votes casted.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the Percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Challenge Overview
The election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit:

1. The voter turnout for each county
2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
3. The county with the highest turnout


## Challenge Summary

Working from this module’s election_results.csv file, use for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find the requested results. Then, print the results to the command line and save them to your election_results.txt file.

Finally, you’ll provide a written analysis of the election audit for the election commission, including the new results and a clearly written overview of your methods. As with all written analyses, this will help your audience understand what you did and what they might be able to do with the data you presented.

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to deliver your results. You will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: The Election Results Printed to the Command Line
Deliverable 2: The Election Results Saved to a Text File
Deliverable 3: A written Analysis of the Election Audit (README.md)
