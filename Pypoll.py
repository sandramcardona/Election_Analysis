#Pseudocode
# In this project, our final Python script will need to be able to deliver the following information when the script is run: 
# Total number of votes cast
# A complete list of candidates who received votes
# Total number of votes each candidate received
# Percentage of votes each candidate won
# The winner of the election based on popular vote



# 1. Open the data file.
# 2. Write down the names of all the candidates.
# 3. Add a vote count for each candidate.
# 4. Get the total votes for each candidate.
# 5. Get the total votes cast for the election.
# 6. Get the percentage of votes each candidate won
# 7. List/print the percentage values 
# 8. Determine and print the winner of the election based on popular vote
